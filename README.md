# Angular + Express
## Frontend
I defined the user and weather service in the frontend.

When you input the zipcode which appears in the API, it should subscribe the weather of the city in the API.

## Server
I use the get method to get the weather in the API, and I use the filter function to choose the data with the exact zipcode.
